# FAQ

## what is Genuary

Like a good copy writer, I answered this question in the very first paragraph of this site's [home page](/). If you managed to skip that, but find this FAQ, then ... well. Were you maybe looking for [FAQuary](faquary)?

## do I need to follow the prompts strictly

No.

## do I need to post every day

No.

## do I need to do the correct prompt on the correct day

No.

## does it need to be X

No.

## can I ... ?

Yes. But please follow the Geneva Conventions.

## what if I don't want to follow the Geneva Conventions?

If following the Geneva Conventions every day is too hard or time consuming, maybe try following them every other day. You could also try combining all your crimes against humanity in a single day, so you can keep the pretense of following the Conventions for the rest of the month.

The nice people at the ICC will probably want to speak to you, please contact them via [their website](https://www.icc-cpi.int/).

## I tried reporting my crimes against humanity to the ICC but their form asked if I am a robot, and I am in fact, a genocidal killer robot. I can't get past the CAPTCHA. What do I do?

This oversight will surely be humanity's downfall. You earnestly did your part however, and if the ICC doesn't want to hear about it, that's on them.

## what if I don't understand a prompt

Try to give it the best inspiration that ends up with the coolest art piece. Write about your interpretation and how it reflects in your piece. Look at other people's art works for inspiration and see how they interpreted the prompt. 

Talk to people and discuss. Really do this, because other people are one of the best sources of inspiration. I even found new inspiration to a prompt I thought I already understood, by doing this! :)

If something needs extra assumptions and you're not sure, just pick some that inspire you most creatively. Then write about which assumptions you picked and why, so that other people can either use the same or choose their own. 

## do I need to make the thing on the day when the prompt is

It really depends on the kind of challenge you want to set yourself.

GENUARY aims to make it possible for people to do 31 daily prompts, one every day, during that day. Though if you want to be really strict, you still have to decide on what time zone the day starts.

If you come up with a different challenge using these prompts, by all means go for it.

If you rather sort of try to do a prompt maybe, then do that!

## can I use code that I wrote previously

Yes.

## what is qxapoiu

A very old web glitch. It was like video feedback for ad networks.

It used to be everywhere, however there are still fragments of it to be found, if you dig.
