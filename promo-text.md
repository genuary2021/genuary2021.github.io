## *Call for participation:* 
## Creative Coders *and* Generative Artists *!!*


GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It happens during the month of January 2021. (yes that is next *Friday!*)

For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a beautiful and inspiring prompt with instructions for you to execute.

You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y'know, we put effort into this. You can use any language, framework or medium. Please respect the Geneva Conventions.

Visit *https://genuary2021.github.io* for more information. Share your work and tag it with **#genuary** and **#genuary2021**. If you're going to misspell it as #genaury, please go all in and include all permutations.
