# HOW DID GENUARY?

I came up with the project in October, when we were talking about Inktober, and some of the people in generative artists club remarked that they had trouble relating the Inktober prompts to code art.

Around the same time I was contacted by someone from @symbiocene.gallery, who had a challenge called "6 simple lines of code", which was to make art that involved those 6 lines of code somehow. I participated of course :)

But then the idea clicked in my head. What if we could do Inktober but with code-related prompts like these? 

The name "genuary" was a pretty obvious pun (it turned out people had already come up with that name last year, but nothing had come of it), and the timing was quite fortunate, with 3 months to make it happen.

So I proposed the idea to the genartclub people and they all really liked it. I knew that the basic minimum what we needed was 31 good prompts and a website. The rest would take care almost by itself.

I got busy on the website, to show this was seriously going to happen, and I got a lot of help from others to make it look good on mobile, and English style improvements. We also started brainstorming for prompts, I think about 12 people helped with that to come up with 47 prompts. Then we had a voting round to select the best 31 and I shuffled them.
