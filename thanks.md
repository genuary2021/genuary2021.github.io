That was #GENUARY2021 everybody!! Thanks so much to everybody who participated! It's been super motivating to see everybody's amazing art pieces every day. #genuary #generative #creativecoding #genartclub

If I learned one thing, it's that participating in the challenge is a LOT more work than putting it together (with the help of my friends). That effort is yours, and it is what has made this project such a huge success!! 

Though I learned a lot more than one thing. I'm quite proud and surprised by the amount and variety of art that I made, that everybody made. Making a whole new thing every day! 

And, #genuary isn't quite finished. I know a few people still planning to do some of the prompts they missed, this week. And there's only 27 images in this collage :) There's a couple of prompts that I still need to do, but I will do them at my own pace.

Huge thanks to all of these people who helped out, came up with prompts, helped make the website, brainstorming, support and being amazing :) They're all listed on the #genuary2021 prompts page: https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts
