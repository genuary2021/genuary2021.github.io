Today, we're announcing GENUARY 2021! https://genuary2021.github.io/

For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt with instructions for you to execute.

You don’t have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y’know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium. Please respect the Geneva Conventions.

Share your work and tag it with #genuary and #genuary2021. If you’re going to misspell it as #genaury, please go all in and include all permutations.
